###### The Concept of Integrated audit over finance, security & controls


### Crypto market overview


Digital assets and blockchain technology (open networks)
became part of our digital world rapidly. For the last 10 years the industry has grown in numbers! Recent price decrease in 2018 for 90% due to overspeculation and market manipulation won't kill the industry. It's not a fault of technology, it's a falut of our understanding how to adopt and use it.

The market is not limited by blockhcian tech, ICOs and cryptocurrencies, new waves is coming from:
* Security Tokens, Non-Fungible Tokens, Stablecoins and DeFi (decentralized finance)
* Institutional players
* Protocol upgrades (segwit, lighting network, sidechains, etc)
* and non-financial services 

Regulation is being developed and matured, thus standards and best practise to be established. 


### The problem definition


There is **lack of trust** towards crypto-business due to number of resons. Crypto business usually is a startup with no or poor management practice over key risks associated with use of digital assets. Crypto business very often remains risky to deal with for external stakeholders like banks, non-crypto  businesses, auditors and professional firms. In addition crypto business often considered with money laundering and other criminal activities.

**Huge hacker revenues** over the years add to fears and superstititions of crypto users. Big hacks means poor security management or unfair management intentions.

Internal unfair or **abusive trading** trading practices with crypto assets as well as non-audited public reporting of exchanges.


### The solution


Independent and innovative audit service could imrove the situation. Similar to traditional economy, strong demand for auditing service will come to crypto industry. 

* To evangelize/promote regular financial, control and security audits and certifications wherever it is applicable and justified. Build propaganda of positive outcomes of auditing service. Learn the feedback.

* Learn crypto businesses how to build more mature organization in terms of risk management and controls; how to identify and address typical risks and provide transparency and accuracy in public reporting.

* Develop and provide professional service helping crypto businesses to mature internal control system.

> Current auditing practice for crypto businesses
> 
> Big4 already announced or did some crypto-related audit engagements. So did Baker Tilly, Grant Thornton and BDO as well. Usually it was confirmation of account balances or collaterals for certain date, rarely - complete financial statements audit. Winklevoss’ Gemini passed SOC-1 audit by Deloitte recently.
> 
> The opposite leg of audit offerings spectrum - code review, smart-contract audits and deeper security tests. This done by dozens of narrow-focused groups or relatively young firms. To name Red4Sec, Kudelsky Security, Smartdec, FP complete, White Hat Group and others. These niche and narrow-focused audit service providers are potential partners for our integrated audit offering.

**There are no signals of existing a more comprehensive audit services, including risk based internal control over assets and data.**


### The opportinity


* Crypto businesses considered high-risky by banks, big auditors and other institutional organizations. Often crypto businesses even couldn’t pass onboarding compliance procedures, unable obtain bank account. 
* At the same time there are number of successful crypto businesses, which are ready to get audited by independent professional body. Demand for such auditing services is growing, yet not too many suppliers on the market available.
* The opportunity is to seed and grow up the integrated auditing service, which is technically capable to render audit services of high professional quality for crypto businesses. Smaller (startup) auditing service might have bigger risks appetites, yet keeping the auditing ethics and principles in place.


### The concept


We want to build proffesional audit practice. That will include,

1. To undertake 6-8 month research and development engagement aimed to:
    * Development of audit approach and framework for audit of crypto businesses
    * Development of generic risk and controls map for crypto businesses
    * Identify standards and best practices, which are applicable to crypto businesses to comply with and adjust their application to crypto businesses specifics
    * Learn existing regulation and external requirements (i.e. GDPR, AML)
    * Identify opportunities for automated audit aid tools and technologies
    * Develop adherence to audit ethics and principles adjusted to crypto realities
    * Develop independence and reputation principles as well as own KYC/compliance criteria
    * Identify opportunities for blockchain applications and tools in audit process  

2. Early practice in limited scope or agreed upon audit procedures with recommendations for clients
3. Build a team of professionals with unique experience and knowledge
4. Build audit business and be a reputative pioneers in industry
